# Object Oriented Programming

**Step 1**
- Create an animal class as our parent

**Step 2**
- create reptile class as the child class
- why? so we can inherit from our parent
- abstract

**Step 3**

``__name__`` and ``__main__`` are used to check if the code is run from the current file/directly or for a different file/importing it


```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    pass
```
This is only true if the code running is the current file.
